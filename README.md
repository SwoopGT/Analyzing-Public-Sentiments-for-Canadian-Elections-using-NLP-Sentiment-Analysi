# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

This repository contains a project involving sentiment analysis of twitter tweets. The models developed will be constructed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for machine learning.

The sentiment analysis is done using two libraries:
1. TextBlob
2. NLTK

Further analysis is done by assigning the weights to the user who tweeted a particular tweet. The assigning of weights is done using:
1. Number of Twitter Followers
2. Number of Tweets
3. Retweets on the tweet posted

Using the above weight assigning, a score is calculated and is used to calculate the user weight and the total sentiment of all the tweets obtained for a particular search query.
